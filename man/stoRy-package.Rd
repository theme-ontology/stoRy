The \pkg{stoRy} package provides utilities for working with \acronym{LTO}
data. The \acronym{LTO} is a hierarchically organized collection of
carefully defined "themes" that can be expected to arise in multiple
"stories" (i.e. works of fiction). Included in the package are functions to
download and cache \acronym{LTO} data, explore \acronym{LTO} themes and
thematically annotated stories, and analyze the thematically annotated
story data in interesting ways.
